Simple tool for sending diseqc sequences using STB card on linux.

Size of each sequence is limited to 6 by hardware and Linux API.
Use dconv -l option for split programming sequences to small pieces.

compiling:
gcc senddsq.c -o senddsq

help:
./senddsq -h

Example 1 (you have ready small-splited sequence)

./senddsq -i myfile.dsq

this command sending diseqc sequences from myfile.dsq

Example 2: (you have .bin file from original app)

./dconv -i myfile.bin -it bin -ot dsq -l 6 | ./senddsq
or
./dconv -i myfile.dsq -it dsq -ot dsq -l 6 | ./senddsq

this commands take myfile.bin (myfile.dsq), converting it to small-pieced dsq and sends thru STB card
