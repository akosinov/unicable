This is my buggy realisation of diseqc for STM32072B-DISCOVERY.

compile:
use eclipse, CDC for ARM, gnu toolchain.
for me, Release is not working, so compile debug
some STmicro files has little mods. be careful

Schematic is simple:
Input circuit: Cable -> small inductor -> filter capacitor -> R-R voltage divider form +3V to GND -> PA1
Output circuit: PA8 -> current limiter 2K R -> GP NPN transitor base, emitter grounded, collector -> 22K R -> Cable
Sorry, i'm too lazy for schematic drawing.

use any st-link for flash firmware, then use USER usb connector on board (side, not center)
some CDC usb device will present in your system.

USAGE:
cat /dev/ttyACM0
	monitor all diseqc traffic
cat somefile > dev/ttyACM0
	push diseqc sequence

SEQUENCE FORMAT:
1. 2-digit HEX separated by spaces finished by linefeed
send sequence. sequence must be 32 bytes max. Input will blocked while sending in progress
2. <.> (DOT). No linefeeds
send EOF back to host
3. <Y> (Y letter). No linefeeds
turn diseqc echo on (default)
3. <N> (N letter). No linefeeds
turn diseqc echo off

all another symbols will be skipped
